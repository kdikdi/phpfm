History:
=====
As always, necessity is the mother of invention.
This project began because I needed an easy way to access my webserver files from anywhere.
As time passed, I kept adding new features to the same file, until it could do everything I wanted.
The first release is a real messy code, I just added internationalization on that thing and released to the community.

Goals for version 2.0
=====
*remain an autoconfigurable, single file management system;
*add all features PHP can possibly offer for file system management;
*add a Macromedia Flash interface featuring directory cache, drag n' drop, context menus, etc...
*extend the internationalization to more than 40 languages like phpMyAdmin project.
